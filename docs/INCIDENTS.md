# Incident log (Momotaro)

**What broke, and what we did about it.** Append-only, newest at the bottom.
Any agent may append directly, this file uses git's `merge=union` driver
(see `.gitattributes`) so concurrent appends merge cleanly.

Log it here when something **actually broke**: a bug that cost real time, a
design assumption that turned out wrong, a deploy or merge that went
sideways, a test that was passing for the wrong reason. This is distinct
from `docs/DECISIONS.md`, which records what we *chose*; this records what
we *got wrong* and what we changed as a result.

Write it while it is fresh. Reconstructing this the night before a demo
produces a list of vague regrets rather than anything useful.

## Why this file exists

Partly engineering hygiene: a team that writes these stops repeating
mistakes. Partly because it is directly assessed. The hackathon's judging
criteria include **"Failure recovery: what broke, and what you did about
it"**, and the honest, specific version of that story is far more convincing
than a claim that nothing went wrong. Nothing going wrong across nine
services means nobody pushed hard enough.

## Format

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD, [short title]
**What happened:** [symptom, as observed]
**Root cause:** [what was actually wrong, once known]
**Fix:** [what changed]
**Prevention:** [test added, doc updated, rule changed. "Nothing" is a
valid but suspicious answer.]

Keep each one to a few lines. A dozen short honest entries beat two essays.

### 2026-08-22, bitnami/kafka:3.9 does not exist
**What happened:** `docker compose up` failed with `failed to resolve
reference "docker.io/bitnami/kafka:3.9": not found`.
**Root cause:** Bitnami restructured their container catalog during 2025 and
withdrew the freely-pullable tags many tutorials still reference. The tag was
never going to resolve.
**Fix:** Switched to the official `apache/kafka:3.9.0` image. Its env vars use
`KAFKA_*` rather than Bitnami's `KAFKA_CFG_*`, and the CLI tools live under
`/opt/kafka/bin/`, so the healthcheck and topic-init command changed too.
**Prevention:** Prefer official upstream images over vendor rebuilds for
infrastructure. Vendor repackaging is a dependency on someone else's
business model, not just their engineering.

### 2026-08-22, kafka-init could not reach the broker it was healthchecking
**What happened:** Kafka reported healthy, but `kafka-init` retried
`Connection to node 0 (localhost/127.0.0.1:9092) could not be established`
forever and created no topics.
**Root cause:** A single listener advertising `localhost:9092`. In-network
clients connect to `kafka:9092`, the broker replies "reconnect to
localhost:9092", and inside the `kafka-init` container localhost is itself.
The broker's own healthcheck passed because for it localhost genuinely was
the broker.
**Fix:** Two listeners. `INTERNAL://kafka:29092` for in-network clients
(kafka-init, kafka-ui), `EXTERNAL://localhost:9092` for host clients
(services run from an IDE). Inter-broker traffic uses INTERNAL.
**Prevention:** Documented both addresses inline in `docker-compose.yml`. Any
new in-network Kafka client must use `kafka:29092`, and a healthcheck that
only proves the broker can reach itself proves very little.

### 2026-08-22, migration created every table then dropped them all
**What happened:** Applying `00001_initial_schema.sql` with
`psql -f` reported nothing but `CREATE TABLE`/`CREATE INDEX` and exited 0,
yet the database was empty afterwards.
**Root cause:** Two compounding mistakes. The migration file carries
`-- +goose Up` and `-- +goose Down` annotations, which are goose directives
and just comments to psql, so psql ran both halves: create everything, then
drop everything. And the check that "proved" it worked was
`... | grep ... | head; echo "exit: $?"`, where `$?` is the exit status of
`echo`, not psql, so a failure would have looked identical.
**Fix:** Added `scripts/migrate`, which uses goose as a pinned library rather
than a separately installed binary, so every agent runs the identical
migrator with no extra install. Verified the resulting schema by querying
`pg_tables`, `pg_indexes` and `pg_constraint` rather than trusting command
output.
**Prevention:** Never apply migrations with psql; use `make migrate-up`.
Stated in the command's doc comment. More generally: `$?` after a pipeline
reports the last command, so use `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` or check the artifact
rather than the exit code. Verifying the effect beats verifying the command.

### 2026-08-22, migration runner hung with no output
**What happened:** `go run ./scripts/migrate up` produced no output and had
to be killed at the 120s timeout.
**Root cause:** `goose.RunContext(nil, ...)`. Goose derives from the context
it is given, and a nil context made it hang instead of returning an error.
**Fix:** A real `context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Minute)`.
**Prevention:** This is `docs/ENGINEERING.md` section 3 exactly, every
IO-doing call takes a real context with a deadline. The bounded timeout also
means a migration wedged on a table lock now fails loudly rather than
blocking CI indefinitely.

### 2026-08-22, dashboard rendered a blank white page
**What happened:** The Bolt-generated dashboard showed nothing but a white
page in the browser.
**Root cause:** `npm install` had never been run, so there was no
`node_modules` and the module graph could not resolve. Nothing to do with the
missing backend, which had been the initial suspicion: the app defaults to its
own mock engine and renders fully with no API at all.
**Fix:** `npm install`. Confirmed with `tsc --noEmit` (clean), `vite build`
(clean), and checking that `/src/main.tsx`, `/src/App.tsx` and
`/src/lib/mockEngine.ts` each returned HTTP 200 from the dev server.
**Prevention:** `npm install` is now the first line of `web/AGENTS.md`'s
running instructions, with the blank-page symptom named explicitly. Also
worth generalising: a white page means the bundle never executed, so suspect
the build or module resolution before suspecting data.

### 2026-08-22, npm 11 silently skipped esbuild's install script
**What happened:** After `npm install`, npm warned
`1 package has install scripts not yet covered by allowScripts: esbuild`.
Vite cannot run without esbuild's platform binary.
**Root cause:** npm 11 blocks lifecycle install scripts by default, a
supply-chain hardening change. The warning is easy to scroll past because the
install otherwise reports success.
**Fix:** In this case the `@esbuild/linux-x64` binary had been placed anyway
and `esbuild --version` worked, so no action was needed. If it had not,
`npm install --foreground-scripts` or approving the script is the fix.
**Prevention:** Read npm's warnings rather than only its exit code. Same
lesson as the migration incident above: a zero exit status is not proof the
thing you wanted actually happened.
